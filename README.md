# Real Data Destruction System

## Overview
This system is designed to securely destroy all data on a target machine except for the operating system. It provides multiple wiping methods, remote control capabilities, and ensures compliance with international data destruction standards.

## Key Features
1. **Real Data Destruction** - Removes all user data while preserving the OS
2. **Bootable Environment** - Runs independently from USB/ISO
3. **Multi-Pass Overwrite Engine** - Supports 1-pass, 3-pass, and 7-pass wiping
4. **Remote Control Capability** - Admin panel for managing wipes across network
5. **OS Protection** - Ensures OS partition remains untouched
6. **Verification System** - Confirms data destruction success

## Components
- Bootable wipe environment
- Secure overwrite engine
- Admin control panel
- Target machine client
- Network communication protocol
- Verification and logging system
